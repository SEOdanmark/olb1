"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold can be a real nuisance, and it&#39;s important to get a thorough inspection (done) to make sure your home is safe and free from this pesky problem. But what do you look for in a mold inspection?

First of all, you want an inspector who knows the signs of mold infestation. They should have experience with identifying potential issues, such as water damage or excessive humidity. A good inspector will also come prepared with the right tools to take samples and detect any hidden mold growth that might not be visible to the naked eye."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How do you test for mold in your house?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Testing for mold in your house can be a stressful experience! It&#39;s important to take the proper steps to ensure you&#39;re getting accurate results. (One) way to do this is through air sampling, which tests the air for mold spores. You&#39;ll need to find an indoor air quality professional who can come out and perform the test. They&#39;ll usually use either a spore trap or settle plate method.
&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What does mold smell like?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold smell (is) really awful! It smells like a mix of musty, dampness and rotting garbage. It&#39;s not pleasant at all and can be overwhelming to one&#39;s sense of smell. In fact, the odor from mold can oftentimes cause nausea and headaches due to its intensity. Furthermore, the stench of mold is often accompanied by a slimy or fuzzy texture when it is touched. Additionally, this type of fungi can even cause respiratory problems in some cases.
&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How long does it take to get sick from mold exposure?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "It can take as little as one day (or even less!) to become ill from mold exposure. It depends on the type of mold and how much you&#39;re exposed to. It is possible to get sick quickly, or it could take weeks! The key thing to remember is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer here. Everyone responds differently to mold exposure, so it&#39;s important not to get too alarmed if you don&#39;t feel any symptoms right away.

However, it&#39;s still a good idea to limit your exposure and be mindful of potential health risks. Some people may experience more severe reactions than others, so it&#39;s important to pay attention and act quickly if you start feeling unwell. Besides physical illness, long-term mold exposure can also cause mental distress such as depression and anxiety - both of which can have a serious impact on quality of life!"

<div class="card-body"><p>Testing for mold in your house can be a stressful experience! It&#39;s important to take the proper steps to ensure you&#39;re getting accurate results. (One) way to do this is through air sampling, which tests the air for mold spores. You&#39;ll need to find an indoor air quality professional who can come out and perform the test. They&#39;ll usually use either a spore trap or settle plate method.<br />

<div class="card-body"><p>Mold smell (is) really awful! It smells like a mix of musty, dampness and rotting garbage. It&#39;s not pleasant at all and can be overwhelming to one&#39;s sense of smell. In fact, the odor from mold can oftentimes cause nausea and headaches due to its intensity. Furthermore, the stench of mold is often accompanied by a slimy or fuzzy texture when it is touched.

<div class="card-body"><p>It can take as little as one day (or even less!) to become ill from mold exposure. It depends on the type of mold and how much you&#39;re exposed to. It is possible to get sick quickly, or it could take weeks! The key thing to remember is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer here. Everyone responds differently to mold exposure, so it&#39;s important not to get too alarmed if you don&#39;t feel any symptoms right away.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s still a good idea to limit your exposure and be mindful of potential health risks. Some people may experience more severe reactions than others, so it&#39;s important to pay attention and act quickly if you start feeling unwell. Besides physical illness, long-term mold exposure can also cause mental distress such as depression and anxiety - both of which can have a serious impact on quality of life!</p>
