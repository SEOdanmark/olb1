"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Have you ever wondered (how do you tell) if there is mold in your walls?! It&#39;s a valid concern, and one that can be quite tricky to answer. Mold is difficult to see with the naked eye, so it&#39;s important to know what signs to look for. The first thing (you need to do) is identify potential causes of moisture buildup on your walls. A leaky roof or pipes are common causes of mold growth. If you have had any sort of water damage in the past, it&#39;s worth checking for mold as well.

"@type": "Question","name": "How accurate is a mold inspection?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold inspections can be very accurate, but it depends on the inspector&#39;s experience and expertise! It is important to make sure that the inspector has the proper training to identify potential issues and signs of mold. (They must also have the necessary equipment and knowledge to properly test for mold.) Mold infestations can cause serious health problems if not addressed promptly. Therefore, it is essential to find an experienced, certified professional who will perform a thorough inspection.

"@type": "Question","name": "What does mold smell like?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold smell (is) really awful! It smells like a mix of musty, dampness and rotting garbage. It&#39;s not pleasant at all and can be overwhelming to one&#39;s sense of smell. In fact, the odor from mold can oftentimes cause nausea and headaches due to its intensity. Furthermore, the stench of mold is often accompanied by a slimy or fuzzy texture when it is touched. Additionally, this type of fungi can even cause respiratory problems in some cases.

The inspectors are also trained to look for visible signs of mold growth, such as discoloration on walls or ceilings and musty odours in the air. All-in-all; while professional mold removal may seem expensive at first glance (it can actually save you money in the long run). Additionally, pay attention to musty odors as these are usually an indication of the presence of mold. In addition to removing surface mold, any underlying structural issues also need to be addressed in order for the problem not return.<br><br> Contact us for a <a class="f06157b983cd5de0a6e2c2f6919c5c26d" href="https://pro-business1.netlify.app/mold-inspection.html">mold inspection</a> today!.</div>

<div class="card-body"><p>Have you ever wondered (how do you tell) if there is mold in your walls?! It&#39;s a valid concern, and one that can be quite tricky to answer. Mold is difficult to see with the naked eye, so it&#39;s important to know what signs to look for. The first thing (you need to do) is identify potential causes of moisture buildup on your walls. A leaky roof or pipes are common causes of mold growth. If you have had any sort of water damage in the past, it&#39;s worth checking for mold as well.<br />
