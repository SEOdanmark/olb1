"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Breathin&#39; in mold for long periods of time can have serious consequences! (It) doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s black, white, or green. It can still be a health hazard, causing coughing and chest tightness. Not to mention the potential damage to our lungs!

(Yet), many people are unaware of this risk. They may believe that they&#39;re safe from harm if they don&#39;t touch the mold or clean it up. But that&#39;s not the case; breathing in mold spores is just as dangerous! Inhaling those particles over an extended period of time can lead to respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis.

Moreover, exposure to high levels of mold has been linked with a variety of other health problems too. People could experience fatigue, difficulty concentrating, headaches, skin irritation and even depression! Mold also produces toxins which can further compromise our immune systems if we are exposed for too long."

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold can be very dangerous, and yet many people don&#39;t realize how quickly it can make you sick! It&#39;s not uncommon for people to think that mold is just an eyesore, but in reality it can have serious consequences. (In fact,) if left unchecked, the effects of mold exposure can start to show within 24 hours.

The first step to avoiding sickness from mold is recognizing the signs. Some common symptoms include coughing and sneezing, headaches, watery eyes, and even chest tightness. If you experience any of these symptoms after entering a room with visible mold, then you should leave immediately and seek medical advice.

Another way to prevent getting sick from mold is to take proactive steps. This includes regularly checking your home or workplace for any signs of moisture or leaks as well as ensuring proper ventilation so that there isn&#39;t too much humidity in the air. Additionally, consider investing in a dehumidifier which will reduce the chance of having excess moisture in your space which could lead to the growth of mold spores.

"@type": "Question","name": "Can mold inside walls make you sick?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Can mold inside walls make you sick? This is a question that many people are wondering about, and the answer is (yes!)! Mold spores can be found in both indoor and outdoor environments, and when they become airborne, they can cause health problems. Not only can inhaling mold spores make you feel ill, but it can also cause long-term damage to your respiratory system. Even worse, (if) mold grows inside your home&#39;s walls, it can actually penetrate other materials like insulation or wallpaper and spread even further into your living space.
Furthermore, mold growth in your home&#39;s walls may not be immediately noticeable. Therefore, if left unchecked for too long &ndash; which happens more often than not &ndash; the health effects could be quite severe. The most common symptoms associated with exposure to mold indoors are runny nose; wheezing; eye irritation; coughs; skin rashes; asthma attacks; headaches; fatigue; nausea and difficulty breathing. In extreme cases of prolonged exposure where there is a large amount of toxic black mold present on the surfaces of the walls, there is even a risk of developing serious infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis!
&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why do you need a mold inspection?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold inspection is very important! (It) can help to identify potential problems in the home, and prevent future issues. It&#39;s essential to have a professional mold inspector come and take a look at your house, as they can detect any possible issues that you may not be aware of. Negatively speaking, if left unchecked, mold growth can lead to significant health hazards and costly repairs.

First off, it&#39;s important to understand what kind of molds are typically found in homes. The most common type is called Cladosporium, which appears as green or black spots on walls or surfaces. Other types include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Stachybotrys Chartarum - all of which can cause serious respiratory problems for those living in the environment.

Furthermore, having a mold inspection done will alert you to any moisture or humidity levels that are too high for your home. High humidity levels create the perfect conditions for mold spores to grow and spread quickly. (It) could mean water damage from leaking pipes or other sources that you don&#39;t know about yet - so discovering this early on is key!

Another great benefit of getting a mold inspection is being able to identify any odors that may point towards an infestation. Musty smells are usually the first sign of trouble - but without proper testing these smells might go unnoticed until its too late! Lastly, if there has been flooding in your area recently then it&#39;s absolutely crucial you get inspected right away; Flood waters often contain fungal spores which can contaminate drywall materials and carpets - leading to a dangerous situation when not dealt with swiftly!"

<p>(Yet), many people are unaware of this risk. They may believe that they&#39;re safe from harm if they don&#39;t touch the mold or clean it up. But that&#39;s not the case; breathing in mold spores is just as dangerous! Inhaling those particles over an extended period of time can lead to respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis.</p>

<p>Moreover, exposure to high levels of mold has been linked with a variety of other health problems too. People could experience fatigue, difficulty concentrating, headaches, skin irritation and even depression! Mold also produces toxins which can further compromise our immune systems if we are exposed for too long.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Mold can be very dangerous, and yet many people don&#39;t realize how quickly it can make you sick! It&#39;s not uncommon for people to think that mold is just an eyesore, but in reality it can have serious consequences. (In fact,) if left unchecked, the effects of mold exposure can start to show within 24 hours.</p>

<p>The first step to avoiding sickness from mold is recognizing the signs. Some common symptoms include coughing and sneezing, headaches, watery eyes, and even chest tightness. If you experience any of these symptoms after entering a room with visible mold, then you should leave immediately and seek medical advice.</p>

<p>Another way to prevent getting sick from mold is to take proactive steps. This includes regularly checking your home or workplace for any signs of moisture or leaks as well as ensuring proper ventilation so that there isn&#39;t too much humidity in the air. Additionally, consider investing in a dehumidifier which will reduce the chance of having excess moisture in your space which could lead to the growth of mold spores.<br />

<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Can mold inside walls make you sick? This is a question that many people are wondering about, and the answer is (yes!)! Mold spores can be found in both indoor and outdoor environments, and when they become airborne, they can cause health problems. Not only can inhaling mold spores make you feel ill, but it can also cause long-term damage to your respiratory system. Even worse, (if) mold grows inside your home&#39;s walls, it can actually penetrate other materials like insulation or wallpaper and spread even further into your living space.<br />
Furthermore, mold growth in your home&#39;s walls may not be immediately noticeable. Therefore, if left unchecked for too long &ndash; which happens more often than not &ndash; the health effects could be quite severe. The most common symptoms associated with exposure to mold indoors are runny nose; wheezing; eye irritation; coughs; skin rashes; asthma attacks; headaches; fatigue; nausea and difficulty breathing. In extreme cases of prolonged exposure where there is a large amount of toxic black mold present on the surfaces of the walls, there is even a risk of developing serious infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis!<br />

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Mold inspection is very important! (It) can help to identify potential problems in the home, and prevent future issues. It&#39;s essential to have a professional mold inspector come and take a look at your house, as they can detect any possible issues that you may not be aware of. Negatively speaking, if left unchecked, mold growth can lead to significant health hazards and costly repairs.</p>

<p>First off, it&#39;s important to understand what kind of molds are typically found in homes. The most common type is called Cladosporium, which appears as green or black spots on walls or surfaces. Other types include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Stachybotrys Chartarum - all of which can cause serious respiratory problems for those living in the environment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, having a mold inspection done will alert you to any moisture or humidity levels that are too high for your home. High humidity levels create the perfect conditions for mold spores to grow and spread quickly. (It) could mean water damage from leaking pipes or other sources that you don&#39;t know about yet - so discovering this early on is key!</p>

<p>Another great benefit of getting a mold inspection is being able to identify any odors that may point towards an infestation. Musty smells are usually the first sign of trouble - but without proper testing these smells might go unnoticed until its too late! Lastly, if there has been flooding in your area recently then it&#39;s absolutely crucial you get inspected right away; Flood waters often contain fungal spores which can contaminate drywall materials and carpets - leading to a dangerous situation when not dealt with swiftly!</p>
