"@type": "Answer",

It can cause health problems like asthma, allergies and even respiratory infections in some cases. But that doesn&#39;t mean you have to panic - there are ways to prevent and treat mold.

First off, (it&#39;s important to) make sure you keep your house well-ventilated and dry. Moisture is one of the main causes of mold growth, so try and reduce dampness by using dehumidifiers or air conditioners when necessary. Additionally, check for water leaks frequently. If these aren&#39;t fixed quickly they could lead to more serious issues such as structural damage or worse &ndash; mold growth."

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Is it bad to sleep with mold in bedroom? (No!) Sleeping with mold in one&#39;s bedroom is not only undesirable but can also be dangerous! Mold spores are microscopic particles that are released into the air and can cause severe respiratory issues. Not only does this make sleeping difficult, but it can also have long-term health impacts. In addition, mold can damage furniture, carpets and other fabrics over time. Furthermore, a damp environment is conducive to the growth of mold and can increase the chance of an infestation.
